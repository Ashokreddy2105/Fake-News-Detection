# Fake News Detection using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting fake news using machine learning techniques, specifically the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The model classifies news articles as either fake or real based on text analysis and feature extraction techniques.

## Features
- Preprocesses textual data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
- Extracts meaningful features using TF-IDF vectorization.
- Implements the KNN algorithm for classification.
- Evaluates model performance using accuracy and confusion matrix.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Fake_News_Detection_KNN
   ```
3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Usage
- Load and preprocess the dataset.
- Train the KNN model with optimal hyperparameters.
- Predict and analyze the accuracy of the model.
- Classify new articles as real or fake based on textual content.

## Results
The model provides a reliable method to classify news articles with high accuracy, contributing to the fight against misinformation online.
